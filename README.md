# MINI-LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The code is for a library manage that will allow the C.R.U.D (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) records of a books and members along with borrow/return functionality, in a console-based interface. The goal is to encourage original design and problem solving.
# ðŸ“š Mini Library Management System
